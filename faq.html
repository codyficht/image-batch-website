                    <h4>What is Image-Batch?</h4>
                    <p>Image-Batch is a powerful Mac app designed for bulk image editing. With it, you can resize, crop, compress, convert, watermark, rename, and find duplicate images with ease.</p>

                    <h4>How does Image-Batch work?</h4>
                    <p>You simply select a folder of images you want to process, choose from Image-Batch's seven versatile features, adjust the options according to your needs, and the app does the rest for you.</p>

                    <h4>What types of image formats does Image-Batch support?</h4>
                    <p>Image-Batch supports a wide range of formats including WEBP, JPEG/JPG, PNG, HEIF/HEIC, and TIFF.</p>

                    <h4>What's new in Image-Batch 2.0?</h4>
                    <p>Image-Batch 2.0 introduces a major overhaul of the app look, making it even more intuitive and sleek. This version now allows you to edit original images in the selected folder instead of creating a new folder with the edited images. Additionally, you can now simply drag and drop your folder into the app, enhancing the ease of selecting images for editing.</p>

                    <h4>How much does Image-Batch cost?</h4>
                    <p>Image-Batch is regularly priced at 9.99 USD. This is a one-time purchase that gives you access to all current features of Image-Batch. Importantly, your purchase also includes free updates, ensuring you always have access to the latest features and improvements without any additional cost.</p>

                    <h4>Where can I get support for Image-Batch?</h4>
                    <p>You can reach out to our support team through the contact form on our website. We're always here to help!</p>

                    <h4>Can I suggest a new feature for Image-Batch?</h4>
                    <p>Absolutely! We're always open to user feedback and suggestions. Feel free to contact us through our website's contact form.</p>

                    <h4>Can I edit images directly in their original folder, or will Image-Batch create a new folder with edited images?</h4>
                    <p>Starting with Image-Batch 2.0, you now have the choice. You can opt to directly edit and save changes to images in their original folder. Alternatively, if you want to keep your original images untouched, Image-Batch can create a new folder where it will store the edited images. This gives you full control over your workflow.</p>

                    <h4>How does the 'Bulk Reduction' feature work?</h4>
                    <p>Image-Batch's 'Reduce' feature allows you to decrease the file size of your images. For JPEG, HEIF, and WEBP images, the app applies compression to achieve the size reduction. If maximum compression isn't enough to reach your desired reduction, Image-Batch will additionally scale down these image types. For PNG and TIFF images, the app uses size scaling only. Please note that reducing the file size may affect image quality, so it's always a good idea to test the results to ensure they meet your expectations.</p>

                    <h4>What is the maximum amount of images that Image-Batch can handle at once?</h4>
                    <p>Image-Batch is designed to handle a large number of images efficiently. While there isn't a specified maximum limit, it has been successfully tested with over 500 JPEG images with dimensions above 2000px processed at once. Performance can vary based on factors such as image size, your Mac's specifications, and the specific editing tasks you're performing.</p>

                    <h4>How does Image-Batch handle folder selection and sub-folders?</h4>
                    <p>When you select a folder for editing in Image-Batch, the app will only process the image files directly in the selected folder. If there are any sub-folders inside your chosen folder, Image-Batch will not access or modify the images within these sub-folders. It's designed this way to provide you precise control over which images are being edited.</p>

                    <h4>How do I edit a batch of photos from the Apple Photos app?</h4>
                    <p>If you wish to edit a collection of photos from the Apple Photos app, follow these steps: First, create a new folder on your system, such as on your desktop. Next, select all the photos you wish to edit in the Apple Photos app and drag and drop them into the newly created folder. Finally, select this folder in Image-Batch for bulk editing. After editing, you can drag and drop the outputted images back into the Apple Photos app if desired.</p>

                    <h4>Can I perform multiple operations like bulk resizing and renaming at the same time?</h4>
                    <p>Image-Batch is designed to perform one operation at a time to ensure precision and efficiency. This means you can't perform bulk resizing and renaming (or any two or more operations) simultaneously. However, after you have completed one process, such as resizing, you can then proceed with the next, such as renaming. This allows for thorough and safe editing of your images.</p>

                    <h4>On which operating systems is Image-Batch available?</h4>
                    <p>Currently, Image-Batch is exclusively available for macOS. It supports macOS versions 12.0 and higher. As of now, we do not have versions available for other operating systems. Stay tuned for updates about potential expansions to other platforms.</p>

                    <h4>Why aren't some images in my selected folder being edited?</h4>
                    <p>If you notice that some images in your selected folder aren't being edited, it could be because they haven't been fully downloaded from iCloud to your Mac. Image-Batch can only edit images that are stored directly on your device. To ensure all your images are edited, check each image in the folder and click on the little cloud icon to download them from iCloud before starting your bulk image editing process.</p>
