                    <h4>What is Image-Batch?</h4>
                    <p>Image-Batch is a powerful Mac app designed for bulk image editing. With it, you can resize, crop, compress, convert, watermark, rename, and find duplicate images with ease.</p>

                    <h4>How does Image-Batch work?</h4>
                    <p>You simply select a folder of images you want to process, choose from Image-Batch's seven versatile features, adjust the options according to your needs, and the app does the rest for you.</p>

                    <h4>What types of image formats does Image-Batch support?</h4>
                    <p>Image-Batch supports a wide range of formats including WEBP, JPEG/JPG, PNG, HEIF/HEIC, and TIFF.</p>

                    <h4>How much does Image-Batch cost?</h4>
                    <p>Image-Batch now offers multiple pricing tiers to best suit your needs:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Free Version:</strong> Access to basic features of Image-Batch.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pro Version:</strong> Priced at [8.99 USD]. This tier gives you extended functionality, as indicated by the <i class="fas fa-lock pro"></i> icon on our home/features page.</li>
                        <li><strong>Premium Version:</strong> Priced at [19.99 USD]. The Premium tier provides our most comprehensive feature set, as highlighted by the <i class="fas fa-lock premium"></i> icon on our home/features page.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Previously, Image-Batch was available as a one-time purchase, which granted access to all its features. Existing customers who made this purchase will continue to have access to all current features and will receive free updates, ensuring they always benefit from the latest improvements without any additional cost.</p>
                    
                    <h4>I previously purchased Image-Batch at a one-time price. Why am I not seeing the Premium version after updating?</h4>
                    <p>Users who previously purchased Image-Batch at a one-time price are automatically upgraded to the Premium version upon updating. It's important to note that this process may take a few seconds after launching the app for the first time post-update. If, after waiting a bit, you don't see the Premium features activated, simply click on the "Upgrade" button at the bottom of the app, then select "Restore Purchase." This action should grant you access to the Premium tier features. If you encounter any further issues or have questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>

                    <h4>Where can I get support for Image-Batch?</h4>
                    <p>You can reach out to our support team through the contact form on our website. We're always here to help!</p>

                    <h4>Can I suggest a new feature for Image-Batch?</h4>
                    <p>Absolutely! We're always open to user feedback and suggestions. Feel free to contact us through our website's contact form.</p>

                    <h4>Can I edit images directly in their original folder, or will Image-Batch create a new folder with edited images?</h4>
                    <p>With Image-Batch, the ability to edit images directly in their original folder is determined by the purchase tier you choose. If you are on the <strong>Pro</strong> or <strong>Premium</strong> tier, you have the option to directly edit and save changes to images in their original folder using the "Direct Edit Mode" (*only available when using folder selection). Alternatively, if you want to keep your original images untouched, Image-Batch will create a new folder where it will store the edited images. This gives you full control over your workflow.</p>

                    <h4>How does the 'Bulk Reduction' feature work?</h4>
                    <p>Image-Batch's 'Reduce' feature allows you to decrease the file size of your images. For JPEG, HEIF, and WEBP images, the app applies compression to achieve the size reduction. If maximum compression isn't enough to reach your desired reduction, Image-Batch will additionally scale down these image types. For PNG and TIFF images, the app uses size scaling only. Please note that reducing the file size may affect image quality, so it's always a good idea to test the results to ensure they meet your expectations.</p>

                    <h4>What is the maximum amount of images that Image-Batch can handle at once?</h4>
                    <p>Image-Batch offers different processing capabilities based on your chosen purchase tier:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lite Version:</strong> You can process up to 3 images at once.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pro Upgrade:</strong> Allows for processing of up to 20 images at once.</li>
                        <li><strong>Premium Upgrade:</strong> Offers unlimited image processing capabilities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Independent of the tier, Image-Batch is designed to handle a large number of images efficiently. While there isn't a strict maximum limit for the Premium tier, the application has been successfully tested with over 500 JPEG images with dimensions above 2000px processed at once. Performance can vary based on factors such as image size, your Mac's specifications, and the specific editing tasks you're performing.</p>

                    <h4>How does Image-Batch handle folder selection and sub-folders?</h4>
                    <p>When you select a folder for editing in Image-Batch, the app will only process the image files directly in the selected folder. If there are any sub-folders inside your chosen folder, Image-Batch will not access or modify the images within these sub-folders. It's designed this way to provide you precise control over which images are being edited.</p>

                    <h4>How do I edit a batch of photos from the Apple Photos app?</h4>
                    <p>If you wish to edit a collection of photos from the Apple Photos app, follow these steps: First, create a new folder on your system, such as on your desktop. Next, select all the photos you wish to edit in the Apple Photos app and drag and drop them into the newly created folder. Finally, select this folder in Image-Batch for bulk editing. After editing, you can drag and drop the outputted images back into the Apple Photos app if desired.</p>

                    <h4>Can I perform multiple operations like bulk resizing and renaming at the same time?</h4>
                    <p>Image-Batch is designed to perform one operation at a time to ensure precision and efficiency. This means you can't perform bulk resizing and renaming (or any two or more operations) simultaneously. However, after you have completed one process, such as resizing, you can then proceed with the next, such as renaming. This allows for thorough and safe editing of your images.</p>

                    <h4>On which operating systems is Image-Batch available?</h4>
                    <p>Currently, Image-Batch is exclusively available for macOS. It supports macOS versions 12.0 and higher. As of now, we do not have versions available for other operating systems. Stay tuned for updates about potential expansions to other platforms.</p>

                    <h4>Why aren't some images in my selected folder being edited?</h4>
                    <p>If you notice that some images in your selected folder aren't being edited, it could be because they haven't been fully downloaded from iCloud to your Mac. Image-Batch can only edit images that are stored directly on your device. To ensure all your images are edited, check each image in the folder and click on the little cloud icon to download them from iCloud before starting your bulk image editing process.</p>

                    <h4>What is the Preferred File Extensions setting?</h4>
                    <p>The Preferred File Extensions setting allows you to choose whether Image-Batch should use Apple's preferred file extensions (e.g., .jpeg instead of .jpg) when saving edited images. You can toggle this setting in the 'Settings' menu to suit your workflow preferences.</p>
                    <p>This setting is useful for maintaining consistent file extensions across your images and can help clean up any incorrect or missing extensions, ensuring a cohesive and organized file system.</p>

                    <h4>What is the Default Export Compression Quality setting?</h4>
                    <p>The Default Export Compression Quality setting allows you to control the export quality of all compressible image types, including JPEG, WebP, HEIF, and AVIF. You can choose your preferred compression level in the 'Settings' menu, which will be applied automatically whenever you edit these image types.</p>
                    <p>When using the 'Convert' feature of the app, the compression quality slider for that operation will override your default setting, giving you flexibility for individual conversions while maintaining a general preference for all other features.</p>

                    <h4>Why does processing AVIF files take longer?</h4>
                    <p>Processing AVIF files takes longer due to the advanced compression techniques used by the AVIF format. AVIF, which stands for AV1 Image File Format, uses a more sophisticated compression algorithm designed to maintain high-quality images at significantly reduced file sizes. This compression is much more complex compared to traditional formats like JPEG or PNG, involving intricate calculations to achieve the best quality-to-size ratio. While this results in superior image quality and efficiency, it also requires more processing power and time. If you're working with AVIF files, please be patient!</p>

                    <h4>What is Largest Side Resizing?</h4>
                    <p>Largest Side Resizing is a feature exclusive to Premium users that allows you to resize images based on their largest dimensionâ€”whether itâ€™s the width or height. Image-Batch will automatically determine the largest side of each image and resize that side to your specified size, while maintaining the image's aspect ratio.</p>
                    <p>This feature is ideal for preserving the proportions of your images while ensuring they all fit within a specific size requirement, regardless of their orientation or original dimensions.</p>
